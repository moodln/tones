# tones
Tones is an interactive application that creates a synesthetic experience for the user. The user is invited to use their keyboard to create different sounds, resembling how they might use a piano. Once sound is produced, an associated color will appear on the screen: warmer colors for higher notes, and cooler colors for lower notes. The colors will dance on the screen as the user plays. 

Bonus features include options for the user to record what they've created, as well as choosing between different color schemes and patterns.  
 
# Functionality & MVPs

With tones, users will be able to:

- interact with their keyboard to create sounds
- use the space key to act as a sustain pedal


In addition, this project will include:

- instructions on how to interact with the page
